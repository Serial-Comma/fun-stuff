      "Teardrop falling from your eyes. You. I don't know why I run away. I'll make you cry when I run away. You could have asked me why I broke your heart. You could have told me that you fell apart. But you bless me like I wasn't there, and just pretended like you didn't care. I don't know I run away. I'll make you cry when I run away. Take me back cause I wanna say your tear for another day. Your tears are another day. Made you that I would always say. I said some things that I should never say. Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did some mine. And now you love me for a second time. I don't know why I run away. Oh girl, I think you cry when I run away. Go take me back. Because I want to say. Save your tears for another. I realize that I'm much too late. If you deserve someone better. Save your tears for day when God is all the day. I know I'll make you cry when run away, baby. For another day. I say for another day. God can't.\n"
